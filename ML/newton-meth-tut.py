# notes:
# - logistic regression
# log likelihood and sigmoid function
#
# understanding the zeros of the function?
#
# Prior knowledge:
# - derivatives and chain rule
# - partial derivatives and gradient
# - basic vector operations
# - numpy
# - independent probability

#
# why is a sigmoid function used as the objection function
#
# why is probability used in the definition?
#
# what is the likelihood function?
#
# so first - it seems that we create the function that
# represents the dataset that we have and what we have in
# mind for it. (this is the real challenge)
#
# Newton's method is just an iterative solution method - so
# I think understanding before that is more important.
#
# data cleaning -> forming the function/model -> applying solution method...

# 0. your questions
# 1. your variables and features  of dataset(s)
# 2. statical summaries and other sub-skills to serach and list out the information.
# 3. more cleaning / data engineering - may need to bring in new stuff.
# 4. now we want to see the correlation and pairplots for each two features.
#
# data cleaning - feature engineering , data engineering, formatting
#
# understanding the function is the prediction?
